# Static Site Generator in Haskell

## Reasons for Starting This Project:

* Learn Haskell and try out functional programming in the real world
* Learn LLM-driven development (or vibe coding) and prompt engineering
* Move my current static site generator from a JS stack to Haskell
* Get a basic understanding of Haskell tooling and testing

## Running the Code

* `cabal run haskell-static-site-generator`
* or simply `cabal run`
